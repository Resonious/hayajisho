# hayajisho
Firefox extension for quickly searching Jisho.org

# Why

There are a lot of extensions that do this already but none of them actually function how I want them to.

What this one does:

* Adds a context menu that searches the current selection on [jisho.org](https://jisho.org) _in a popup window_.
* Adds a toolbar button with a jisho.org search box.
